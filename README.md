# Landmark-detection-py
Landmark detection and recognition using Google's Landmark Detection V2 dataset. This dataset contains 5 million images, split into directories, and a train.csv. Since it is impossible for my computer to be able to train a model for the galore images present, the code takes very few images from three directories.
